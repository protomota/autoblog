Provided Research Data:
{research_summary}

Instructions:
1. Based on the provided research data, write a comprehensive blog post about {topic}.
2. Your post MUST include:
   - Working code examples in Python
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions for each code block
   - Clear explanations of any dependencies or setup required
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Best practices for implementation

3. Format code examples as follows:
   - Show complete, runnable code (no pseudo-code)
   - Break down complex implementations into smaller, digestible chunks
   - Provide comments explaining key parts of the code
   - Include example output where relevant

4. For each code example:
   - Explain what the code does before showing it
   - Explain how to install any required dependencies
   - Provide any necessary configuration steps
   - Explain how to test that the implementation works

5. Blog Post Structure:
   - Start with a brief introduction to the topic
   - Include implementation prerequisites
   - Present code examples with explanations
   - Add troubleshooting section if relevant
   - Conclude with next steps or advanced usage
   - Footer that references the research links

Note: All code must be tested and verified to work. Include version numbers for all dependencies.
