## Installation & Setup

1. **Create Your Project Directory**  
   Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_project
   cd my_project
   ```

2. **Clone the Repositories**  
   Create a new repository on GitHub for your blog site, then clone both repositories into your project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-blog-site-repository-url>
   git clone <blogi-repository-url>
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**  
   In the project root, create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Unix or macOS
   .\venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install all required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configuration**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root to store your configuration variables. For example:
   ```env
   # API Keys
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key  # Used for accessing Anthropic's API to generate content.
   BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key          # Required for Brave Search integration to retrieve relevant information.
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key          # Used for OpenAI integrations, such as processing language generation requests.
   USERAPI_AI_API_KEY=your_userapi_ai_api_key  # Provides API for Midjourney image generation.
   USERAPI_AI_ACCOUNT_HASH=your_account_hash   # Provides API for Midjourney image generation.

   # Full Obsidian Notes Path (no trailing slashes)
   OBSIDIAN_NOTES_PATH="/path/to/your/obsidian/notes/vault"  # Specifies the directory where generated blog posts (Obsidian Notes) are stored locally.

   # Blog Base URL (no trailing slashes)
   BLOG_URL="https://your-blog-url.com"  # The base URL for your live blog site, used for linking and deployment.

   # Blog Site Repo Name
   BLOG_SITE_REPO="my_blog"  # The designated repository name for your blog site, referenced during deployment to correctly sync and build the site.
   ```
   *Ensure you configure all necessary variables required by `blogi/core/config.py`.*

## Running the Application

The application is set up as a Flask app that is served via Hypercorn for async support.

1. **Start the Application**

   From the project root directory, run:

   ```bash
   python -m blogi.admin.main
   ```

   This starts the server (by default on address 0.0.0.0 port 9229). You can adjust the configuration in `blogi/admin/main.py` as needed.

2. **Access the Interface**

   Open your browser and navigate to:  
   `http://localhost:9229`

---

## Using the Interface

The web interface is accessible via the browser and is designed to be both responsive and interactive:

1. **Configure Your Post**
   - **Agent Type & Name:**  
     Select from the provided dropdown list. The agent type determines the required fields.
   - **Researcher Agent:**  
     - Enter a topic in the Topic field.
     - Click **"Generate Post"**.
   - **Artist Agent:**  
     - A webhook URL is required for processing images.
     - Optionally, provide an image prompt if you don't wish to use a randomly generated prompt.
     - Use the **NGROK** and **Midjourney Webhook Server** buttons (under the server section) to start the required servers.
     - Adjust the chaos percentage (optional) using the slider.
     - Click **"Generate Post"**.

2. **Console Log**  
   The page includes a console log area that displays real-time feedback and error messages during generation and deployment.

3. **Deploying Posts**  
   Once a blog post is generated (the filename becomes visible), you can click the **"Deploy Posts to Blog"** button to sync content, build the static site with Hugo, and push changes via git operations. The result will be visible in the console log area.

## Development Notes

- **Requirements File**  
  All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. Make sure to install them in your virtual environment.

- **Main Server (admin/main.py)**  
  The Flask application and async endpoints are defined here. This file handles:
  - Generating posts using the `BlogAgent` found in `core/agent.py`
  - Starting auxiliary servers (NGROK and Midjourney) using AppleScript commands
  - Deployment logic via `DeploymentManager` from `core/deployment.py`

- **Client-Side Interactions (admin/static/js/main.js)**  
  The main JavaScript file is responsible for:
  - Handling form submissions and AJAX calls to endpoints (`/generate`, `/deploy`, etc.)
  - Managing UI elements such as spinners, button text changes, and form persistence
  - Controlling field visibility based on the selected agent type

- **AI Agents (core/agent.py)**  
  This file contains all the logic for:
  - Validating agent configurations and required fields
  - Generating content, titles, and tags
  - Saving content to the filesystem (e.g., as Obsidian Notes) and preparing paths for deployment
